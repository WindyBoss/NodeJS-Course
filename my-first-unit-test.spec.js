        Test stubs are functions (spies) with pre-programmed behaviour.

        As spies, stubs can be either anonymous or wrap existing functions. 
        When wrapping an existing function with a stub, the original function is not called.

        Sinon.JS ships with a set of assertions that mirror most behavior verification methods and properties on spies and stubs. 
        The advantage of using the assertions is that failed expectations on stubs and spies can be expressed directly as assertion failures with detailed and helpful error messages.
        To make sure assertions integrate nicely with your test framework, you should customize either sinon.assert.fail or sinon.assert.failException and look into sinon.assert.expose and sinon.assert.pass.
        The assertions can be used with either spies or stubs.
